process
1. create symlinks in gallery
2. create full-size photos/videos in gallery
3. create thumbnails in gallery
4. create directory index.html:s in gallery for changed directories and where doesn't exist
5. delete old redundant gallery files (those that don't exist)

backlog
- autorotate pictures (start with bimgtest)

release 2
- print progress indicator
- make full-size and thumbnail creation concurrent
- check that each of symlink, fullsize and thumbnail exist

hotfixes
- how to quickly check emptiness of directory?
- TODO go through all the todo stuff

both exist
source is newer than gallery -> update source (!source.exists), don't delete gallery (gallery.exists)
gallery is newer than source -> don't update source (source.exists), don't delete gallery (gallery.exists)
source and gallery are as new -> same as B
